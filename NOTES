## 5.3 Computing Bias
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
- Bias in computers could be a good or bad thing
  - Example: netflixâ†’ recommends shows based on genre interests
  - This is good for business because it gets more money if people stream on services longer

## 5.4: Crowdsourcing
Public Data Sets:
- Kaggle
- Google Public Datasets
- Data.gov
- Local Government
Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.
- Crowdsourcing can be seen in many places
  - Example: Wikipedia 
Distributed Computing:
- A ton of computers do 1 task
Examples:
- Spotify with collab playlists
- Crowdfunding like kickstarter and GoFundMe
- Blockchain like crypto and other tokens

## Github actions

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
The owner thinks this is intentional because it only worked on his white cowerker.

How do you think this happened?
This probably happened because the code did not include black faces for facial recognition.

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
This is harmful because its not inclusive, but I doubt that it was intentional.

Should it be corrected?
It deffininetly should be corrected to have this tech available for more people.

What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
include all face types when creating a facial recognition software

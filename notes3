The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended:
The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community
 Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or the culture
Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
